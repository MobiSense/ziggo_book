# List of Basic Knowledge
We reiterate that using or developing ZIGGO-CaaS-Switch or ZIGGO-Device has a high threshold; you must have certain hardware and software knowledge. If you have no previous experience in hardware development, you may need to carefully consider whether you are suitable for this project, as learning these skills is very time-consuming.

Learning to use the ZIGGO project demands higher requirements than traditional development tools like FPGA, MCU, ARM, etc. Mastering ZIGGO devices is not something that can be achieved overnight.

If you wish to use the ZIGGO project, you should at least have the following knowledge:

## Hardware Knowledge

* Principles of Computer Organization
* C Language
* Fundamentals of Digital Circuits
* Verilog, VHDL languages
* Good foundation in English reading

## Software Knowledge

* Principles of Computer Organization
* Computer Networks
* Computer Operating Systems
* C, C++ Languages
* tcl Scripts
* Good foundation in English reading
