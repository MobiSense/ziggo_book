# Preparation Checklist
## Software Environment Checklist

### Vivado Development Environment

Vivado is the hardware development program for development boards.

Official download address for Vivado software by Xilinx: http://china.xilinx.com/support/download.html

Our development team uses the ***2020.1*** version of Vivado, and we recommend that ZIGGO project users also use the same version to avoid unnecessary trouble.

For the specific installation process, refer to [ZYNQ Application Tutorial](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/f9f1a4f92a344e8e9c2c/) **Chapter 3 Vivado Development Environment** for installation.

### MobaXterm

MobaXterm is a serial connection tool, which we introduced in the chapter "Launch the Board and log in" in [hardware_build.md](/ziggo_book/docs/device/hardware-build/).

Official download address for MobaXterm: [MobaXterm Xserver with SSH, telnet, RDP, VNC and X11 - Download (mobatek.net)](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)

If using a large number of development boards, consider connecting all development boards to a standard switch, then connecting the switch to a PC (via Ethernet) for management and use.
