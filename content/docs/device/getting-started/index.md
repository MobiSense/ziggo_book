## Introduction to git branches

| Branch Name     | Basic Function | Packet Resize | Online Analyze | Offline Analyze |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| main            | √              |               | √              |                 |
| packet_resize   | √              | √             | √              |                 |
| offline_analyze | √              |               |                | √               |

The branches of TSNPerf submitted this time can be divided into three categories. But the main branch is inconvenient to use in two ways. In order to solve the above two limitations, we have also submitted two patch branches.

* The `main` branch contains basic time synchronization and pkt_gen functions, as well as online analysis functions. However, its limitation is that it can only send Ethernet of MTU (1500B) size, and due to the limited performance of the zynq development board, online analysis may cause packet loss.
* `packet_resize` branch can send Ethernet frames of any size (64B-1500B).
* `offline_analyse` branch can forward the data packets to the PC for offline analysis to avoid packet loss. 

> Note1: When switch to 'packet_resize' branch, you also need to modify the `software/config/flow.json`

> Note2: When switch to 'offline_anaylze' branch, you need to link device to anthor PC (linux) by wire in ETH1.
