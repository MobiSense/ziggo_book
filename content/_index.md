# Welcome to ZIGGO TSN Platform Tutorial!

**ZIGGO** is a flexible, standard-compliant, and control-function-virtualized TSN platform ready for industrial control, automotive electronics, and other time-sensitive applications.

Currently, ZIGGO consists of three tools ZIGGO TSNPerf, ZIGGO Switch and ZIGGO Device.
ZIGGO TSNPerf is a comprehensive and user-friendly TSN evaluation toolkit. It provides TSN protocol compliance verification and network performance evaluation.
ZIGGO Switch is a hardware and software co-designed TSN switch, fully supporting IEEE 802.1 AS, Qbv, Qav and Qcc, realizing nanosecond time synchronization and microsecond critical traffic transmission.
Using ZIGGO Switch together with our self-developed TSN end device, ZIGGO Device, you can effortlessly establish an intuitive TSN testbed.

We believe this tutorial will help people in other research fields break into Time-Sensitive Networking research and learn more about its protocols, principles, designs, and implementation skills, promoting prosperity in the field of Time-Sensitive Networking.
